# Booklet Pages – Student Guide

**TL;DR**  Each week you upload one handwritten page. At the end of term these pages become your personal **A5 exam booklet** that you may use during the final test.

---

## 1  Why are we doing this?

* Regular note‑making beats last‑minute cramming.
* The booklet lets you carry *your own* summary into the exam.
* The process (selecting, compressing, writing, technical setup for creating readable scans) is a valuable learning activity.

## 2  What can go on a page?

* Key ideas, formulas, diagrams, worked examples, mnemonics.
* Summarise & organise – don’t copy whole slides.

## 3  Format rules (must‑read)

| ✔︎ Allowed                                         | ✘ Not allowed                      |
|----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Entirely **handwritten** text & drawings (tablet or paper)           | Typed text (except one small header) |
| Your own sketches & mind‑maps                      | Screenshots or copy‑paste from slides/videos |
| Multiple handwritten snippets arranged digitally   | Content written by someone else    |

**If a page breaks the rules it may be discarded. If a booklet containing invalid pages is used during the exam, this may be treated as academic misconduct due to the use of non-authorized aids.**

## 4  Working with others

Discuss together, then **write and submit your own pages**. Sharing files counts as misconduct.

## 5  How to submit in Moodle

1. Open the **Exam Booklet Pages** section.  
2. Click the assignment **Page N** for the current week.  
3. Upload **one file** (PDF preferred, JPG/PNG ok).  
4. Only the **first** page of a PDF is used.  
5. You may replace the file any time before the deadline.

## 6  Image‑quality checklist

* Scan/photograph in good light, no shadows.
* Crop & rotate so text is upright, e.g., using a popular scanner apps like Microsoft Lens, Adobe Scan, or Genius Scan.
* Aim for **300 dpi** at A5 (~1770 × 2480 px).
* Zoom to 100 % and check readability before upload.

## 7  Deadlines & troubleshooting

* Deadlines appear next to each assignment. **Late uploads are not accepted.**
* Upload early; last‑minute network issues are your risk.
* Wrong file? Delete/replace it before the deadline.
